Once born in a mighty place, paradise they call their home,
Hidden in their heart sweet memories a treasure of their own,
One night some conspirators came with a foolproof plan,
Destroyed everything and threw them to a far away land,
Their silent nights are pierced by the memories of bullet sounds,
Their wings bear the burden of loss of identity and a life with no backgrounds,
Eyes darkened with despair, loss and pain,
They scuttle, as sky showers scuds instead of rain,
Imagine being forced to flee your home in search of safer grounds,
If you are lucky, you had time to pack a bag, if not, Run! With wounds,
What have they done, why do they run in helter-skelter,
Away from their home only for shelter,
Loaded with fears, their eyes filled with tears,
With clothes torn and tattered, and hopes all scattered,
For what they are punished, innocents thrown out like rubbish,
Just a life of survival, for sake of revival,
The land never voices for borders,
Then who are we to give orders,
Neither the river denies nor the air modifies,
To be distributed for living lives,
Are we not the same,
Just ‘REFUGEE’ …. not given the name,
Who wasn’t a refugee, at some point in time… in our lives?
With accessories and attire but shattered desires,
We are the world, we are the children!
We are humans, out to our brethren!
Let’s stand for once together in their moments of distresses,
Let’s open the mighty doors of our high walled fortresses,
God has put no boundaries, embankments, borders either,
Who are we to claim… it is not ours, theirs neither!
The brooks, the springs, the fields,
The wealth, the joys, the yield,
Not yours, not mine, let’s share,
Show ourselves we’re humans and certainly we care,
Who knows what destiny will, bestow on us tomorrow,
There’d be plenty to share, they’d stand with us in sorrow,
Nearly 20 million people around the world live on the edge, living a difficult life- sad but true!
They are our brethren, and to ensure they live and die with pride is the least thing we must do !!
Let’s give everyone a reason, to live with dignity and smiles,
Let’s shout out loud and clear, let the message go worldwide,
Before our words just lose their way into the heaps of files!
