“Reply to your Frankfin application”, a mail popped on my cell phone screen while I paced towards my apartment, greeted by heavy rain and an over flooding crowd of people rushing past each other. It was about 11 pm and I could see nothing but people drenched in sweat and rain simultaneously, a sight no one would want to envision, but as they say, ‘It’s New York, the city that never sleeps.’

“We’re sorry to inform…..”

That was it. I didn’t have the nerves to read the complete mail. I knew its contents all the way since I gathered the courage to enroll for it despite the list of phobias I possessed. “I shouldn’t have enrolled in the first place”, I muttered in gloom, striking a hand over the deep scar on the left of my face, and all of a sudden the crowd I was a part of, appeared pointing and giggling at my charred face while some faked sympathies in the state of my misery.

“They’re all laughing at me, that’s what they do. No, I need no sympathy, I need no one”, the insecurities came flooding to my mind as I tried pulling myself together and ran with all my capacity towards my apartment, all set to sink into my pillow and soak it all night with all the torment and pain I was unable to hold.

In an attempt to cut every single person from my sight, I raced towards the closing doors of the only vacant elevator in the building for the last thing I wanted that time was to face any living creature on my way. “For god sake!”, I was vexed on finding a man in black attire inside the elevator, dozing like a drunkard as I succeeded in reaching it on time. I leaned against the wall mirror to stabilise my breath and emotions. The long mirror by the wall welcomed me with a giggle while my scarred face stood glued to it and within a moment, I began to sob with tears rolling down my cold cheeks.

“Hey! you alright?”, the man in black interrupted.

It wasn’t long before I realized the familiarity in the tone, the attire, the ring on his third finger, and every single thing about him.

“Damn!”, it was him. Damon. Damon Salvatore, the 508-year-old vampire. ‘Do vampires even exist? , Am I losing my mind already? How can he possibly be here, like in my apartment?’ Millions of questions ran through my mind as I stared at the tall, handsome figure in black that stood right beside me, interrogating me of my wellness, Jeez he was even cuter in reality, his eyes even brighter and the three lines on his temple even finer, but before he could answer any of my queries, the elevator stopped with a ‘thud’ blowing away all the lights.

In the darkness of the captivity, I stood stiff and numb unable to sync with the strangeness of the moment, before he flashed a light on my face and I couldn’t help blurting out, “Are you for real?”

“As real as the charismatic scar you possess”, he winked.

“Oh! Is it?”, I chuckled, “trust me that’s the last thing you wanna say”, I sighed sinking to the floor of the elevator.

“Bad day? Wanna grab a bourbon? I compelled it for myself” , he grinned while I sat there with my pupils dilated at him, thinking if Bourbons even existed these days.

“How do you happen to be here, at Eleanor heights or even in New York?”, I asked with curiosity.

“Regretting for another blood lust episode, Ah! Never mind, I liked the bar here”, he sighed.

So his humanity was intact then, of course it was, otherwise I’d have been in hell by now, beheaded! I just wished I possessed that humanity switch, while I grabbed the bottle of bourbon and downed all its contents before I began to air my dirty laundry on his face, “….. this bloody scar ruined all my dreams”, I ended with a sigh.

“Hey Damon, can you turn me?”, I asked him without giving it a second thought if vampires or the supernatural world even existed. The only thought that crossed my mind was to turn off my emotions and feel nothing for I’d have been weeping under my pillow by then, if not for him.

“Is that what you want blondie?, here you go”, the only words I remember before he looked me straight in the eye and chanted, “You’re beautiful the way you are!”

“I’m beautiful the way I am”, my lips moved in succession with him and within the blink of an eye, the universe appeared bizarre to me. The scar, it was still intact, only that I saw it with a different outlook. Damon, he was, shortcuts being his dearest asset, no doubt he must have compelled me to forget.

“Did you just compel me?”, I asked rather exclaimed.

“Bingo!”, he winked and the elevator resumed, sparkling with light and “puff”, he was gone with his supernatural speed.

They say you can’t spell ‘Damon’ without a damn and that’s the most appropriate thing I’ve heard in my life, for he was the best thing that ever happened to me. “Let the world be damned!” I yelled while I walked towards my room, flaunting my lovely scar. Oh! I missed that last dance with him.
