Dear Diary,

Why am I still wondering around, eh? I know I will never be able to figure it out, but still!

I wanted that story to be a subtle coffee shop romance along the lines of something I always dreamt about. Something… something that casts a spell with the very first read, a momentary magical illusion that no one can escape.

“… her perpetually crossed legs were like noodles. Her hair was a bird’s nest with poison needles at the ends. Sandra’s non-sensible sanity was always visible through ‘em angelic eyes, but what everyone failed to see was her overcast heart! …”

I know my metaphor game was never strong enough, but I guess I was already too deep in love with that image to let go.

They informed me that I had some eleven odd days to put it on paper and submit it for publication and, though my wise side reminded me of my junior high nickname “Procrasti-writer”, I thanked God for being so generous towards one of the best pieces of my not-so-long writing career.

So, being the inveterate procrastinator that I am, I just put it off for a week because an absolute masterpiece needs the perfect resting phase development before it comes to life, you know! wink wink\*

After seven full days of checking useless coupon emails a gazillion times, adding and discarding multiple items from my Amazon shopping cart, conducting never-ending Twitter battles over whether YouTube is better than TikTok, stalking my kindergarten-friends’ Facebook profiles, googling my own name a thousand times over, I finally decided to write something down.

While I definitely had the plot of the story in my mind but, I totally forgot that I don’t have a name for it yet. The most crucial part of being the creator of a life-changing story is, of course, the title!

“The Coffeehouse” would be too clichéd, right? How about “Café” then? Wait, aren’t they synonyms? I must go for something really abstract. Maybe I am not inspired enough right now.

After striking some thirty possible titles out, I was convinced that I had the infamous and utterly dreadful condition called the Writer’s Block.

It wasn’t the first time I was in such a situation. I knew my way out of it. So, I pulled my trustee-favourite Murakami novels out of my shelves. It would take time, but I knew Kafka would definitely be the one who would help me reach my eureka moment.

Three more days went by. I did come up with a title that was worth it, though. I called it “11 days, an hour and 36 minutes”. Beautiful, ain’t it? It didn’t appear from any inspiration drawn from Kafka on the Shore, though. It was the exact time from the day they asked me to write to that point.

Yes, I MISSED THE FRICKIN’ DEADLINE.

After making creative excuses, they allowed me another two hours, out of sheer generous dissatisfaction.

See, as writers, we all have two major fears inside. One, the Deadline Syndrome, which has already had its fair share with me.

The second one is what I refer to as the Fear of Turning in Nothing. It’s worse than the first one, I must say.

So, I started writing in a panic. No metaphors, no ornamental character descriptions, just a simple 1000-word text, and without re-reading it even once, I hit Send.

It was definitely not the eureka moment I was waiting for. It was a familiar feeling of instant regret, disgust and sorrow. I had again proved myself a glutton for the tasteless and pointless oatmeal cookies. I had nothing left to say.

Two days later, I received an email that said, “Loved the story, man! It was so damn relatable.” I was surprised because out of embarrassment, I’d decided not to check the story after it was published.

So out of curiosity, I logged in, and I was taken aback by seeing my story at the top of the Trendings Chart! It was the absolutely last thing I expected to happen.

It was soothing, yet so confusing at the same time. I was proud of my pen-baby’s success, but I was abso-frickin-lutely clueless. All I had at that moment were questions.

Maybe, we live in a mediocre society. Maybe, sometimes it’s the simple stuff that is rather beautiful. Maybe, procrastination and overthinking do give rise to creativity.

We might never have actual answers to these.

But after all these years, there’s one and only one satisfying truth about being a writer out there, and Anaïs Nin quoted it beautifully-

“This diary is my kief, hashish, and opium pipe. This is my drug and my vice. Instead of writing a novel, I lie back with this book and a pen, and dream, and indulge in refractions and diffractions… I must relive my life in the dream. The dream is my only life. I see in the echoes and reverberations, the transfigurations which alone keep wonder pure.”

Goodnight.
