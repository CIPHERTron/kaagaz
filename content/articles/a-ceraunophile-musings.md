I downed my morning coffee. Its bitter taste was just the thing needed to clear my mind as I slowly turned the pages of **_Looking for Alaska_**, a book by John Green. I reached the end, almost suddenly, drowning in emotions. I took a deep breath and closed the book. My mind was fuzzy and filled with things to ponder, trying to recollect each and every detail. Yup, that’s the feeling of completing a good book.

**_“If people were rain, I was the drizzle and she was the hurricane”._** There is always one quote in every book that stays with you. This was one of them. I remember that cold morning when I first read this quote in the book. And since then I have tried to interpret it in thousands of ways!

With this line alone, Green has perfectly encapsulated how Pudge loved Alaska. All he could think about was her; they both taught each other different dimensions of living life. The picture of this quote in my mind is of how he spotted her in the crowd, just like we pick out the best apples from a bevy of fruits. Little did he know, her bold and fiery personality was what would keep him attached to her. She was nothing short of a hurricane. She would pull everything into her. She was the hurricane he, a **ceraunophile** – a lover of storms, loved to mess with. He was the drizzle she loved to get soaked in.

What would it be like to be someone’s hurricane in life? I’ve been wondering about this ever since. And this journey of wonderment has brought me to a poem. A poem I believe Pudge would have written.

At one point we did love each other
At one point we seemed eternal to each other
You were the hurricane that shattered down my heart
And even after knowing how much it will hurt
I chose to stay.
Chose the storm over the breeze.
I on the other hand was the drizzle that let you blossom.
I tell you to stay for a while
Just let me look deep into your eyes
And find the stars
All that are musings from my dark sky.
I hold your hand and say
That every hurricane eventually runs out of rain
A little drizzle is all you need.
You said that some words are better left unspoken. And you left.
I kept wondering about the unsaid words until I realized
You need me for your use,
You need me so that you can grow.
I smiled and cried.
Oh! What a pity-
I gave you too much of me
And now it feels incomplete.
Would you mind returning back?
You have been on my mind lately,
You have been in my dreams lately
But all I have is our memories.
Maybe I should accept that
You and Me, we just were not meant to be.
How do I tell myself
That in this world
Friends turn into strangers
Forests change into deserts
And flames freeze to death.
How do I?
I write you into letters of these alphabets
Over and over
Until the words repeat themselves
Like a broken record of an old forgotten song,
Still which is not enough
And I will tell myself stories
Of how our worlds will meet
Someday in a parallel universe,
This time without any regrets.
It’s been a while since you left
You never returned to even answer;
It took the death of hope to let you go
To let ‘us’ go
But there will be a piece of you in me.
But I am tired now,
I can’t chase you anymore.
The very breath we take is pure
Example of what comes has to go.
Now I finally understand.
