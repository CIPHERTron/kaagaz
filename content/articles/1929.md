**_“Dhoni finishes off in style, a magnificent strike into the crowd, India lift the World Cup after 28 years”_**

_Iconic words, befitting a true sporting icon._

The man who redefined the term finishing, the man who led Team India through its most successful phase in international cricket, has brought the curtains down on what has been glittering international cricket career.

Dhoni _stumped_ everyone (pun intended) when he announced his retirement from international cricket on the day the nation celebrated Independence Day, but the cricket community soon got its act together. Tributes poured in for the captain who had won it all. Tributes poured in to remember, to savor, to cherish the many memories this man had gifted us as we exhaust our stock of superlatives to adorn him, as the eternal enigma quietly walked into the sunset.

The boy who emerged from the streets of Ranchi and made his mark internationally in probably the shortest span of his cricketing career is an inspiration to millions and an assemblage of life lessons on and off the field. Being unorthodox yet successful, he has shown us that risks do pay off and proved that we need not follow a fixed way to achieve what we want, but follow the method that suits us best.

All good things must come to an end, and this has been an absolute peach. We all knew that this day would come, and it did. MSD gave 1.3 billion Indians another reason to unite on the 15th of August. Just as he had so many times before.

The sheer, unanticipated manner of the announcement was fitting of Mahi’s style; doing things the Mahi way. The whole nation came to a standstill. Goodbyes are indeed hard. But the realization that the phrase _‘Dhoni sambhal lega’_ will echo emptily, hits harder.

The man who overcame all sorts of ordeals to get to the top, and then proceeded to lead us to the top, will be sorely missed. The fact that this man who kept us on the edge of our seats with excitement, but calm and relieved deep down whenever he played, will no more be seen finishing off in style at the international level is a real heartbreak. All the nail-biting finishes and goosebump moments spanning over a decade and a half will be missed, and the memorable moments when he backed himself when pushed to the edge, will remain evergreen and forever be cherished.

From switching off our TVs when Sachin got out to having our hopes alive till Dhoni was at the crease, Indian Cricket evolved. The screams of joy from all the corners of the country, the proud feeling of being an Indian while seeing him play will be adored by those who started loving cricket because of him. More than the victories, trophies, and a good team, the hope and sheer belief he instilled in the fans till he was there on the crease despite the waning abilities will be his greatest ever contribution to the nation.

The last of MS Dhoni in blue, returning teary-eyed back to the dressing room with his world cup dream shattered, will pain forever. His glorious career which shone with him becoming a cult hero, when India won the coveted trophy once again after 28 years, certainly deserved a better end.

While cricket has given us many greats, Dhoni will be remembered as the never-seen-before kind of player who contributed across divisions on the cricket field. Whether it was the remarkable self-control, flawless decision making, unparalleled wisdom, calm demeanor, and the ability to change the tempo of a match, either through big-hitting, blind stumping, an uncanny change in the field or entrusting the unlikeliest of bowlers to win the game, his unique manner of encouraging players from behind the wickets, or his helicopter shots that have won hearts, the list of his endearing acts goes on. His will be tough boots to fill. But his legacy goes beyond figures and is reflected not only in the history of Indian Cricket but as the nation’s heartthrob.

Dhoni was the last remnant of a golden era. He bridges the gap between a glorious past that flourished and a dominant future that awaits. While he finished uncountable matches for the men in blue with his incredible hitting in the death overs, his tendency to take the game deep earned him plaudits from all corners of the world. His retirement will be remembered as the most Doni-esque way of quitting. However, the loud shouts of **_“Mahi maar raha hai”_** will continue to echo as he continues to don the yellow jersey for Chennai Super Kings in IPL.
