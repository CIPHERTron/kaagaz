_1 am; 28th June 1969_

_Stonewall Inn, Greenwich Village, NYC._

It’s an unusually hot summer night. The heat in the air is palpable. The tension too. These coppers had to rain down on us sometime, yeah? They gotta wag their tails at their vote-hungry masters’ whims, eh? With the elections coming up, dressing up plain for a party to wrecking ours seem to be the instructions from the ‘reps of the people.’

Having no rights includes not having the right to protest. The police can just walk into the bar and arrest you for a plethora of reasons that the lawmakers stick into their heads. It’s sad to see the 200 of us go down without a fight. I question why, but I’m quick to realise that we’re all gripped by the same fear. Fears, in fact. The primary one is incurring the wrath of armed police, and being meted out some more discriminatory behaviour.

The plainclothes are now nitpicking crossdressers and trannies and loading them into their vans. Their demeanour suggests they’re loading livestock, not humans. Pushing, shoving and hurling the dirtiest of fa\*\*ot slangs. My blood boils on seeing them pick out lesbians and harass them. The notorious lust in their eyes and on their hands doesn’t seem to reflect the law they so fervently abide by. Irrespective of your sexuality, no one deserves such treatment. I look around at my fellow onlookers. I sense we’re all gripped by the same emotions, for we’re all on our toes, not knowing when an officer is going to come for us. We’re all angry too, but that anger knows better than to be let out.

The alcohol, the torrid heat, and the commotion have cooked up a nasty concoction in my head. My mind traces back to when I burst out in front of poppa, him that his ‘sonny girl’ is a tranny. A transgender woman. Though not under any influence, the old b\*stard beat me worse than his drunk arse ever had. I feel a hint of the suffocation, as memories of me weeping in the cellar come back. A bit panicked, I try to move behind a couple of drags to get some air.

“Where do you think you’re going there, lady?” I hear a gruff copper voice go. It’s directed at me, I sense. “Or whatever breed of fa\*\*ot you are, ahaha.” The handful of officers let out a disgusting laugh. A bit dazed, I make eye-contact with him. Heck, I should’ve been sober. Sensing my vulnerability, the burly, red-shirted man moves swiftly towards me. I look to retreat, but there’s nowhere to go. A trickle of fear drips down my forehead.

“Oh, look at you poor thing. What are ya doin’ here? Let me guess. Daddy’s girl has double-crossed herself, and now she’s hangin’ out with the trannies, huh?”. The expression on my face gives me away. He smirks, like a hunter when the prey walks right into his trap. Taking me violently by my right arm, he goes, “Hey, Billy, check sonny princess here out. **_She’s a good girl gone bad.”_**

The way he says it, I almost know that I am going to feel his hand on my backside. I feel a lump gather in my throat. “No, not again, not today!” my insides cry. This isn’t the first time I am being harassed, but the despair and the anger that has built up in me make me jerk myself free of his hold.

“WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING, COPPER?”, I cry out. “YOU THINK YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO ME AND I’M GOING TO STAND IT LIKE A F*CKING DUMMY?”. My voice is cracking. “ALL OF YOU F*CKING DUMMIES HERE, DO SOMETHING! THESE COPS HERE CAN’T TREAT US LIKE SLAVES!”

He is clearly taken aback by my outburst. “Calm down there, you tranny wh\*re, we’re not doing anything but putting you where you ought to be.” He moves to get a hold of me again, sternly trying to impose his dominance over me. A wave of desperation passes through me as I try to wrest myself free of his control, like a fish gasping for water, when a shrill voice cries from the crowd, “Mister, let go of the lassy!”. A few other voices cry out in support, “Let go,” “Let go, Copper,” “Boo!”.

The policeman has a strong hold of me by now as he tries to force me out through the crowd, but the air of unease on his face is visible. The growing dissenting voices are adding to his task as he’s trying to look for a way to get us to his comrades. These voices, the pain his iron grip is causing in my wrists and back, are adding to the nasty concoction in my head. I’m drowning in the clamour, until I’m snapped out of it by a-

CLAAAANNGG! CRAAASHH! broken a bottle somewhere.

A policewoman shrieks as I hear the metallic ringing of pennies clattering the wooden floor beneath.

BAAANGG! SKRAASHH! I hear a couple more bottles break.

The piercing noise is numbing. Shrieks again. This time a man. Some more unsavoury words are hurled at the police. The decibels are growing and the tempers are rising.

Sensing that things might turn ugly, the copper acts to deal with me first. Seeing him take a pair of handcuffs out, I violently try to shake myself free. He doesn’t let up though, he’s too strong for me. The sight of our physical altercation is provoking the crowd further, who are now sounding like a growingly angry mob. My anguish is growing too, my struggle is foremost for a lung full of air. He’s managed to bring my hands together, but his dirty hands are instead probing against my backside.

“Ughhh,” I cry. I let out a tired sigh. Not only do I feel wasted but used as well. An overriding sense of vulnerability passes over me. How am I so helpless? Surely, a human can’t be this weak?

The amalgamation of toxic feelings in me is rising. I can’t let myself fall prey this easy. The agony I had felt all these years is antagonizing me. The cacophony of the same resentment echoed by the raging onlookers is persuading me to react. The heat of the moment gets to my head and sets a spark off. I combust.

_Disgusted and enraged_ with my mind in a whirl, I impulsively spit on him.

The onlookers go “Ooooooh!” and a pin drop silence falls over the Stonewall Inn. _Disgusted and enraged,_ the copper slaps me hard in my face. I see stars, and then nothing.

_8am; 28th June; 1969._

_The New York Tribunal:_

**Iconic scenes as sparked LGBTQ supporters riot at Stonewall.**

In a first-of-its-kind uprising, an angry crowd of LGBTQ supporters stood up to the New York police during a raid at the Stonewall Inn, Greenwich Village. In a rare showing of proactive rebellion, the resentment borne by the protesters spilled out as they rioted against the discrimination faced by the LGBTQ community. The protests began at around 1am today when an officer allegedly harassed a transgender woman while arresting her, and culminated in an emphatic victory for the protesters as they cornered the hapless police inside the bar around 4am. On the hottest night of the summer, the suppressed finally got the spark they needed to make their voices heard.
