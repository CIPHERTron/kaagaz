His feet stopped moving as his eyes followed the sound of fluttering wings. The shade of the sky turned a tinted yellow as the sun shone dully on the narrow lane perched with bright chrysanthemum leaves. He tried to look around to savor the brilliant colors all around him, but he couldn’t feel anything. As if the entire place is dead with not even an ounce of life oozing through its veins.

He saw the rusty old gate through which he entered this place three years ago. He gave up on his hometown for this University to study Art. His bicycle under a shade of brilliant orange now, he began to move slowly and look around this place he had known for years. It didn’t bring a sense of nostalgia for him; if anything, it gave him an air of dull numbing sadness only deepening as the years passed by.

The university, situated in the far eastern frontier of the Capital, is well renowned and respected for being a state-sponsored university. Like several students, he spent years preparing for the university test in the hopes of getting a state-funded scholarship that would ease the burden on his retired father. But, as soon as he entered that rusty gate, he felt the heavy dark fog that seemed too eager to welcome him. His intuition told him that life isn’t going to be easy for him and that he has to fight many invisible demons if he had to make it out of this place.

Looking at things now, he always knew he could never make peace with his demons. As the years went, he saw pale silhouettes slipping from dorm terraces and no one talking about it the next day. He saw depressed kids being told to snap out of it by the university doctors only to see their tender necks snapping at the noose in their dim-lit dorm rooms. They were completely unfazed, even when they did the autopsy of the same kid that was living and breathing on their comfy sofa couch a day or two ago. Death is like the only absolute certainty at this place, lingering like an invisible fog ready to engulf the next passing lantern that comes it’s way.

He wasn’t mad at the university for preaching how suicide isn’t an option or organizing a prayer of silence to mourn for the dead. Whenever such an incident happens, the university just points their fingers at the rehabilitation center with a mere staff of four psychiatrists for an entire strength of ten thousand students and washes its blood-soaked hands. He was mad that they showed a false sense of hope to the people at the lowest rungs of despair when there was none.

But getting mad wouldn’t help anyone; in fact, nothing would help. He saw how things are as the years pass by and finally accepted the finality of it. Things here are beyond saving, he thought. The corrupt bureaucrats, the cascading walls of that showpiece of a rehabilitation center; they would just suck the soul of these lifeless moving people like Dementors. Not that it mattered or he cared anymore, he just accepted the way things work here.

With his eyes sunken deep and his face shivering from the breeze, he sat down on a nearby bench with lighting a cigarette in his frost-bitten lips. Taking a deep drag, he began to make neat strokes of the dilapidated gate that looked like a rusty guillotine under the fading evening sky.
