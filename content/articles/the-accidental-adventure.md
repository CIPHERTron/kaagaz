“We’re all either a station waiting for the right train or a train in search of the right station.We dwell so much on the outcomes that we forget to enjoy the journey.”

I stood there with a bag-pack around my shoulders and my sling bag hanging across my body that I clenched with my dear life for the fear of my valuables getting stolen; so much for the thoughts of a paranoid person.

I was on a solo trip. Trip makes it sound way too exciting. Honestly, I was just going back home from my grandparents’. It had become a rather monotonous cycle for me, back and forth from home to grandparents’ house, stopping by the dahi-bara wala who sold THE best dahi-bara.
This rather prosaic cycle slowly seeped into me. It became familiar; the roads, all the stops, the chai shop that’d open at 6:30am every day, the morning prayer at the nearby temple. This treacherous road that once used to be scary and unfamiliar had become my comfort zone to such an extent that even the slightest ambiguity stressed me out. Anything remotely au courant made me uncomfortable and I was too naive to realize that I was stuck in this viscous cycle of stagnation and was blinded from the idea of new experiences in the name of comfort.

It was just another day, coming back from the same route, eating the same dahi-bara at the same place, that I slept off and woke up to realize that I had missed my stop and was 600 kms from home. Shivers ran down my spine as I pondered about what had just happened. This place was entirely different, the people, the shops, the streets, the trees everything seemed outlandish and anomalous. I was so used to my small, crowded, congested town that I didn’t know how to function when I saw the clear skies and greenery everywhere. The air smelt different. It was clean and fresh. It seemed to rejuvenate my insides. It took me a while to calm my nerves and recover from what had just happened, and to go and enquire about how to get home. When I found out that the next train back home would start off in four hours, I was paranoid, yet relived. Paranoid because my conscience was constantly worrying me about how state-of-the-art everything was and obsessively guilt tripping myself over how careless I had been. Relived because, holy mother of god, I had never seen a place as beautiful and serene as this.

The sun shone brightly, its rays cutting through the dense morning fog, the buzzing chatter of the people interrupted by the chirping of birds, the green hills creating an ombrè with the blue skies and dense white clouds.

For the first time in a very long time, I felt free and alive. I was free from the chains of comfort that had weighed me down. I finally realized that there was more to life than amenities and comfort, more roads to take, new food to eat, new people to meet.

With a sense of zeal and a new found happiness and love for exploration, I finally had the ardent desire to step out of my shell. I sat next to a fellow traveller talking about random things as we sipped chai from a nearby chai stall, something that I didn’t think I’d ever do in a thousand years.
