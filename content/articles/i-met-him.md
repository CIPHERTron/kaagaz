No, it wasn’t raining cats and dogs. It was literally pouring in buckets. And I stood there – a desperate, lonely, over-dressed teen with a bunch of flowers, as hopelessly romantic as I could be. It had been two hours, and Martin was nowhere in sight. I gulped. He would probably never come. I definitely didn’t want my Valentines Day to be wasted because of him. I stared into the elaborately decorated Bloxham Hotels. There was just one way out- I needed to take myself on a date. A young couple brushed past me as I was busy pondering if he had actually dumped me. After all, I had been ignoring the signs for a long time now. “Never mind!” I consoled myself and headed into the hotel.

The Bloxham was literally my dream in reality. The entire hotel was aesthetically put. I fell in love with every single arrangement that day- the chandeliers, the red carpet, and gold and red balloons stuck to the ceilings. “If only ..” I sighed.

The restaurant was located on the twelfth floor. “Tring” – one elevator had just arrived. I could see a gentleman enter it. And it was closing! I dashed to get the closing doors of the elevator. Fortunately, I just set foot in time. I glanced at the other person from the corner of my eyes. He was a tall man with a black overlay coat and one of those Sherlock Holmes hats that’s been in trend these days. I moved a little forward to get a proper look at his face. I mean, I wasn’t stalking. But just in case, he might be cute! You know what I mean. Unfortunately, or fortunately, he turned towards me right back. My eyes widened. My pupils dilated. He took my breath. There, beside me, stood Sherlock Holmes. The Sherlock Holmes.

I had never believed in those TV rumors for so long. So, it was true then, he was alive! In the words of Irene Adler, “The clever detective in the funny hat.” I breathed to myself, “God! He’s so handsome. I mean, why?”. Meanwhile, he had funnily looked at me as if he just scanned my life in a look.

I have been such a great fan of his cases. I mustered the courage to speak. I opened my mouth, trying to figure out how to start and what to say. Suddenly the elevator jerked violently. The lights began fluttering. And “Cling”. The elevator stopped abruptly, and the light went out.

I stood in the dark like a puppet for some time, disgusted at my fate. You know that feeling when you get to meet your Lord, but it’s just for a moment, just as in dreams.

“Hi”- said a deep flattering voice.

I was startled. Realizing there was just no one else than the two of us, I replied sheepishly “Hi… Hi me? Oh Hi. I am Nancy.”

“So, what’s his name?” Mr Holmes was speaking.

“His name? I am sorry, whose?” I was much confused.

“The young, selfish man who ditched your plans today.”

I was taken aback. How on Earth did he know anything about Martin, or me? I didn’t recall blurting out anything in front of him. “Umm. His name is Martin. Sorry, how do you know about anything?”

“I don’t know. I just observed.” He probably smirked in the dark. Now that isn’t a big deal for him to find out stuff.

But I was much curious. I pushed back a strand of hair and asked “But …How is it possible?”

“Okay. It was easy. Your pink dress up and your little heart-shaped earrings say that you are very likely here for the Valentines. But your faded lip gloss and a slightly messed hair, the beaten look in your eyes as you entered the elevator panting and rushing, all point to the fact that you had been waiting for somebody for a long time before you gave up hope he would ever turn up.”

I was already impressed but also flushed.

He continued,” There’s a bunch of flowers in your hand. From what I can smell, you are also wearing an expensive perfume. If you ditched him, you would have been cheerful, and all dolled up. But no. It was you who was trying so hard to impress him. You came here beforehand waiting to surprise him as he comes but he never turned. So, he is the one rather.”

I was so embarrassed that tiny drops rolled down my cheeks. It was true. It had been hard. He always kept canceling plans last moment, avoided me in public, and had been acting so weird in the last few days. I sighed. You are right Mr Holmes. That’s a sad story.” I smiled a bit. “Anyways nice to meet you. I am such a great fan of yours.” I extended my hands in the dark. And after a bit of struggling, he took my hands and shook it warmly. The lights flashed and the elevator started moving again.” You know what I have decided to take myself on a date today. That’s funny, I know. Well, what about you?” I smiled.

“Well, young lady. Know your worth. You are a smart, pretty lady. The right one will never leave you in doubt. Keep smiling.” he paused before continuing “And as of me, I am here all alone.” He smiled back. His dark brown eyes glistened in the light. He was definitely a breath-taking highly functional sociopath. “By the way, do you mind having your dinner date with me?” he asked.

“Oh yes! Obviously. That’s so sweet of you!” I replied. I couldn’t believe my luck. I mean who would have thought celebrating the valentines with someone you so absolutely love and admire with all your heart. “Twelfth floor”, the elevator buzzed. He led me to a cozy corner. Everything about the place was so so romantic, the heart-shaped balloons at one end and the red lighting. White and red roses were beautifully put in a vase on the table. And an interesting date for a night. I couldn’t have asked more. It’s unbelievable, right?
Sometimes, after all the fictional tales are dearer than the reality!
