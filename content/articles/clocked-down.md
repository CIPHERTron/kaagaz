It’s been over 14 years since poppa left. Left for good, cuz I’m sure a man like him went to God’s good heaven. He left, with many questions and few answers. Too many why’s for my liking. Left, too early with reasons I cannot guess but perhaps with an overwhelming sense of despair, one that’s washing over me right now.

My mind feels like a canoe adrift in a weltering ocean, the only thing keeping it afloat despite the heaviness it’s drowsy drugged self carries is the lighthouse. My only companions in this lonely hour are the bottle of scotch and cigarette in my hand. Companions helping keep me afloat, I’d say. The lone bulb burns a mellow yellow, lighting up the attic with a tinge of melancholy. The last bit of light fell on his soul before he choked it out of his body, standing on the stool I’m sitting on. If I look up, I might as well see him looking down at me.

I don’t think I want to look up, though; I’ve had no one to look up to since he left anyway. “Stopped ticking” as the crooks at school put it crudely. If only there were any oil that could make a clockmaker’s heart tick again.

The passage of time is supposed to heal wounds and bring clarity. I’ve barely ever felt any. Ain’t nothing definite in this mind of mine. A mine about to explode any second. Might as well be the light in m hand to set it off. It’s probably poppa’s watch here that’s ticking down. It was passed down to him by his father, who was a clockmaker and kept on this table he used to write since the **_12th of May, 2006_**. The day he passed away. Mum set the date and laid rusting here next to a couple of now empty jars of grey paint ever since. Currently, they serve as an ashtray. The grey couldn’t be a more stark reminder of my nicotine addiction. Well, at least something is filling up the burning emptiness.

The watch, a 19th century gilded timber artifact, is quite a relic. I wipe the dust off its face with my thumb, and the numbers show themselves to me. 12 / 05 / 2006. The hands show 4 am. I’m surprised I’ve never paid attention to the watch earlier. Seeing the date doesn’t revoke the happiest of memories, but I don’t think I can drown any further in the sadness. Staring at this watch in my hands makes me go numb. It’s like feeling a part of him.

I don’t think he’d be proud to know his junkie son has dropped out of college and is neck-deep in drugs in his memory, while his wife is working three jobs a week to make ends meet. I doubt he’d have thought of such a scenario, let alone a pandemic ravaging the world. If only we could go back and set things right before they got so fucked up.

Yeah, _let the world explode. And be reborn perfect, free of sorrow._ I continue gazing at the watch, the shiny, finely curved glass reflecting the bulb above. The fiery yellow was almost resembling a flame. Hell, maybe this watch is going to explode. The flashes of light are sure a hypnotizing trip.

I’m lost in the watch when I’m snapped out of it by a flicker in the glass. I try to catch a glimpse of the bulb with the corner of my eye. I’m sure as hell too high to move. The watch flickers again, and I’m intrigued. Maybe it’s my mind playing tricks. The watch flickers again. I take a closer look at it. There’s nothing but the reflection of the bulb shining back at me. I’m bemused. Whatever was that, huh?

I set the watch down, but as I’m doing so, I notice something that sends a shiver down my spine. My hands have frozen. I can feel tears building up in my eyes. I stand sh\*tless.

The watch is ticking. It’s just past _4 am, 18/08/2020_. There’re beads of sweat on my forehead. I can’t believe my eyes. The mechanical whir of the second’s hand as it ticking anticlockwise is echoing in my head. I can’t tell what’s louder, the echoes of my heart beating at 90.

Then, the thought grips me. Despite my inebriated state, I can tell there’s no rationale for such ideas. I’m controlling the urge to do it, because well, since when did drunk people start encountering the dead? I’m so paranoid I’m aware of every breath I take. No, I can’t muster up the balls to do this. But I impulsively do it anyway.

I look up at the ceiling. I’m surely hallucinating. But no, he’s looking right down at me, the rope around his neck playing ornament. His face just as it was when he was laid to rest. Emotionless and cold.
And then the stool slipped, and there was nothing, just infinite darkness.

I wake up on the floor of the attic several hours later, with the bottle in pieces and the cigarette bud lying in the rubble. The stool and table had taken a crash too. Damn, I thought to myself. Last night must’ve been bad.

I hurriedly got back on my feet, smearing my hands with the grey paint spilled on the floor during the events of last night. Strange, the cans were empty, I had painted the porch just yesterday evening. Regaining my balance, I looked down once more at the mess I’d made. That’s when I noticed that the paint hadn’t spilled. From what I can make out, the painted letters read, “See you.” Beads of perspiration trickle down my forehead. It is disturbingly puzzling. Surely it was just me and my thoughts in the attic last night.

Between the painted words lies the watch in perfect condition, not a scratch on it. Completely lost and terrified down to the bone, I pick it up. Strangely enough, there isn’t a drop of paint on the watch. As if it’s been wiped clean. The watch seems to have been placed on the floor purposely, whereas it should’ve been in pieces.

Well, I only wish it was.

What the f*ck ever is happening, it certainly can’t be *4 pm, 17/08/2020\*.
