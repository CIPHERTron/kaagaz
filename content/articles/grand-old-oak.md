Grand old Oak. He was always an optimist. A glass half full kinda guy. His spirit was contagious to all us trees that surrounded him and to all the creatures he housed. The myna would sing, the squirrels raced, moss clung to his feet, and mushrooms bloomed. He didn’t mind at all. He whispered and giggled as the gentle spring breeze tickled his leaves and sheltered all that came to him.

We were a pleasant bunch in a lush little grove. Oak, the oldest one of us, was also the liveliest, wisest, strongest, largest. He’d spread his branches and touch our tips when we were hurting. He’d invite the woodpecker onto him, the rat-tat-tatting that we found ever so annoying resonated with him.

He taught us that nature made us a giving species. Food, shelter, seeds, water, safety. He taught us that the creeper that bore into us wouldn’t survive if we weren’t there; the little twigs the sparrow plucked away from us were going to be the home of her little babies; that the seeds we made may not grow into lush trees but they could keep the friendly squirrel fed through the unforgiving winters; the tire hanging from my droopy branches was the most joyous toy for the little boy as he would swing and giggle from ear to ear. He made me who I was.

Was.

You see, what he never taught us for our own good was that nature also made a taking species. And that is what they did.

They came one day, demanding for a park, a free space for the children to play and began chopping us down. He remained stubborn as our numbers reduced, as branch after branch, bark after bark fell with thuds. His leaves shivered and whispered comfortingly.

I was the last to go, as the tire hanging from me rolled away. He told me I was going to fulfill my purpose no matter what, and I fell away.

I could see the little kid crying. His own little playground, his own little swing-set, was now no more, and I knew I was going to miss him. He ran to the Oak as the chainsaws bearing their teeth moved with him, and he hugged him, refusing to let go, as stubborn as the old tree. And they gave away.

Our little grove is no more, and the old oak stands resolute still. He shelters all that come to him, wild creatures, or tired children. The little boy has grown, and he comes to him every day, with his own little kid, who climbs and hugs the grand old Oak.

Seeing him, I realise why Oak never taught us about humans. You see, a lot of them may be a taking species, but ever so often, you meet one that makes giving selflessly to them worth it.
