Escaping the chaos and hubbub of life, I sit there, in the special corner of my tiny, rented house gazing out of the two-paneled window. It provides me with a beautiful and mesmerizing view of the Oak trees standing tall and strong amidst May’s scorching sun. Still, the one that grabs my attention is the vine trying to climb the garden wall, weak and dry, withering away with every passing day succumbed to the cruel and intense heat.

It probably portrays a clear picture of me, fooled by life, and all the disappointments of the day come thriving before my eyes. ‘Is this all the qualification you have?’ ‘You need to be a bit more confident,’ ‘We don’t find you relevant for the job.’ A number of ‘Whys’ revolve around my mind along with the nasty thoughts of those overcrowded buses, stinking roads, lousy food, and not to forget, the piercing sun adding deliberately to the bedlam of my life. It feels like everything is falling apart, with pieces degrading and shattering away from my empty and baseless life, all set to end soon, just like my savings leaving behind no means of survival.

The hunch that everyone around pinches me bitterly for not being like the rest, and no matter how beautiful I plant the garden of my life, the autumn seems beyond cessation. Engrossed in grief, I see the chirping birds retreating home amidst the dark sky and the bright sun disappearing among the nimbus clouds. In the complete darkness of the day, the tall trees begin to sway vigorously along with the weak vine trembling, quivering, and struggling hard for support. The colorful and delicate flowers start to wither away along with the sturdy trees shedding their leaves in effect to the terrific and destructive storm.

They gave competition to my despairing thoughts and notions, which compels my heart to go pounding louder and louder with the blood in my veins rushing and gushing terribly, thriving goosebumps throughout my burning skin. The lethal, deadly storm picking the dust and ruins from dry and thirsty earth and scattering them around matches the screams prevailing my mind as I begin to shiver. The angry clouds start to collide and roar with tremendous intensity striving thunders. Excessive lighting cracks through the vast sky, represent the protruding red nerves through my heavy eyes all set to burst simultaneously.

My gaze still fixed on the battling vine as it wears and tears away in succession, compels me to believe that both of us would cease to exist within the next moment. The heavy clouds, along with my heavy heart, are unable to sustain the overflowing sea of emotions. They yield before the destiny, and the universe begins to yell, scream, and weep along with me.

Drenched in emotions and heavy rain gushing through the two-paneled window, I catch a glimpse of the struggling vine with a certainty of never seeing it again. But to my surprise, I find it fresher, brighter, and greener than ever with a sense of calm and relief. The dry and thirsty ground fills with a sweet and enchanting fragrance of soil, and the craving birds begin to chirp with rejoicing. When in the fiery month of May, a sudden comfort, though for a fraction of a moment, thrives through lives, my hopeless and troubled heart begins to beat with a new zest and will, compelling me to struggle and live through another day just like the ivy vine.
