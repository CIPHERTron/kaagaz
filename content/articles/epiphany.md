A usual day of November dawned upon Sheetal as she entered home with a glistening piece of gold adorned around her neck. This was her 7th gold medal of the year. There wasn’t a field where she hadn’t excelled yet. At the age of 11, she was the proud owner of a cupboard full of medals and trophies. She was the star debater, an acclaimed dancer, and the beacon of academic excellence at her school. Her parents never got tired of praising her. She was the object of envy for all her cousins and neighbours. Their home was swarmed with relatives from far and wide to enquire and congratulate on her success. Her chest swelled with pride, as her parents too reveled in the wave of success that had just swept in.

Those were the moments of bliss. Or should I say, tiny bits of momentary bliss?
As she grew up to be a teenager, her parents and a larger part of society had conditioned her to believe that she wanted to become a doctor. Because that’s what toppers did. They either became doctors or engineers. Her parents supported her in every possible way. She was taken aback a little by how her parents listened to her choices and communicated with her so openly about every issue she faced. The unwavering attention overwhelmed her.

Slowly, reality started haunting her. She couldn’t handle the heavy books and unending syllabus that was covered at a cheetah’s pace. Her “cool” girl gang had deserted her. She burned out and flunked her tests. She wasn’t the prodigy anymore. In a nutshell, things had taken a rough patch recently, as her grades started dipping in secondary school. She had been finding it hard to focus. Of course, her parents took the blame for giving her more liberty than she deserved. Things just got worse than ever. The dipping grades, the feeling of past entitlement, and her parents’ increasing bashing pushed her mental health down the drain.

Finally, she had decided. She had to consult a therapist.

Sweat beads formed around her forehead as she looked at her reflection in the mirror. She had done this for the zillionth time, yet she fumbled more every time. She found her dark circles getting darker and darker, her body getting weaker and weaker, and she was losing hold of her life faster. She tried to communicate her feelings through writing and sketching. But, all those couldn’t fix her life. In fact, she realized she became more irritable and eager for validation with time. She couldn’t stand any human company around her anymore. Or maybe, she just hadn’t any company humane enough to understand her.

Depression had got better of her.

She had made a hard effort to concealing her self-harming scars with a forced smile, and her dark circles were dabbed with makeup. She had become used to all these lifestyle changes. These changes also probed her to think of Death. Often, she would hallucinate about how the world will be a better place without her. She began envying those who embraced a peaceful death without having to care about their dear ones.

The only thing that gave her chills was the conversation she was going to have with her mother about consulting a therapist. Though she had revised this conversation a million times over in her head, her mind and her heart were still at internal conflict. This dissent had only escalated over the last two years. With heavy steps, she trotted to the kitchen, where one of the most heated conversations in this house to date will happen today. As she wished herself luck, her brain reminded her, “Just say it .” She knew she would regret it if she didn’t.

“Mom, we need to talk.”

“Yeah, sure. Your lunch is getting ready, dear.”

“It’s not about that, Mom. This is serious.”

“Okay, go on. I am listening.”

“Mom, I am not feeling very well these days. My head’s in a daze, and I can’t figure out where my life is headed to. The academic load is too much for me to handle. I want to do something different. Since most of my friends just wanted a piece of my pie of fame, they also left me. My life’s gone astray. What should I do?”

“Okay. Calm your nerves first. You should see a counsellor then. Or maybe a therapist? Shall I book an appointment for you?”

“Really? Don’t you think it would project myself as a mentally retarded person in front of the society? I don’t think that’s a very good idea. My personal life will be out in the open for a stranger. I can’t live normally again.”

“No, dear. If you think your mental health is in jeopardy, you should definitely go for it. You shouldn’t put your life at hold for people who don’t even matter.”

As she smiled a generous smile for the first time in ages, Sheetal was ruthlessly snapped out of her trance.

“Sheetal, what is it? SHEETAL!!!”

“Huh? Yeah, Mom. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something important.”

“Fine. It better be important. And what urged you to come here right in the middle of your studies? You flunked your tests again, right? Or is it some bullshit party you want to go to again?”

“Mom, it’s not about that. Please listen to me calmly. I am not feeling very well these days. My head’s in a daze, and I can’t figure out where my life is headed to. So, I think I need to consult a therapist.”

A curtain of ominous silence swept across the room, just like the silence before an impending storm. Sheetal had expected this silence. Her mind was in a disheveled mess. Either her illusionary expectations would come true, or she would be grounded for life. She was not just ready to take in more negativity. As for her mom, she couldn’t recognise who her daughter was anymore.

“OHHH!! So, let me soak this in. You want a therapist? You want all people to call you crazy? What’s wrong with you, huh? You don’t get awards and accolades anymore, nor do you fair even averagely in your tests. And now, you shed crocodile tears in the name of mental wellness and therapy. It’s such a shame to have you as my child!! Let me make it very clear; you don’t need a therapist, okay? All this is JUST in your mind. You keep making plain rubbish excuses to get rid of studies, that’s all. Now go back to your room and study. This conversation is done.”

“But, Mom? I really don’t want to become a doctor. I need some time and medical attention. Try to understand, please.”

“Sheetal!!Back to your room, NOW!!”

Sheetal went back to her room in silence. The same reflection mocked her for being so naïve as her mom’s words echoed in her mind. She sunk into her pool of tears, desperately trying to pick up the shattered pieces of her broken soul, her idyllic world vanishing into emptiness, once and for all.
