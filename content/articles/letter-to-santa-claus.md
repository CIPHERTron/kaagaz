Dear Saint Nick,

Growing up, the most formative exposure I had to Christmas was books and television. They’ve always followed a very strict stereotype: snow on the windowsill; a crackling fire in the fireplace, spewing smoke out of the chimney; stockings hung from the mantelpiece; a giant conifer decorated with tinsels and toppers and stars and baubles; fairy-lights spreading a flickering, colourful hue into the entire room; sumptuous spreads of roasted meat, puddings, gingerbread and hot cocoa; a faint melody of an approaching choir; and of course, presents! It is a beautiful wholesome aesthetic.

But sadly, it is one I could never expect to enjoy. I grew up in an apartment, you see, in Mumbai. Needless to say, there was no snow, no fireplace, no chimneys, no stockings on mantelpieces, no knocking choir groups, no reindeer, and no real Christmas tree. The only authentic Christmas prop I could hope for were presents. And I sincerely doubted I would have those too. I could never really imagine you to manoeuvre your entourage of reindeer and carriages around towering buildings, or be able to squeeze through the tiny gaps in the window bars of my house to leave me something, even the smallest piece of coal. But I still hoped.

And boy, did you show up!

I remember putting up my Santa hat for you on the window once. I didn’t have stockings and my socks were all too small to fit the box of Pokemon cards I had written to you for. I kept an alert watch too, in the hopes of catching a glimpse of Rudolf or Dasher or at least Comet. I stayed up late, fighting to keep my eyes open. But I ended up dozing off. Suddenly, I felt movement – a surreal presence. I jumped awake, and there I saw. My bright red cap, bulging under the weight of my gift. You showed up!

Then there was the time I was out playing with my friends. The Christmas cheer was palpable and all any one of us could talk about, was when you would show up and what you would bring. When I returned, I found a surprise package hanging from the door knob, waiting for me. And your large boot prints in the dusty corridor were far too great an evidence of your visit to miss! You had showed up again.

But your most memorable visit would forever be the last one. I was travelling back home by train and, as I swayed in the jittery berth, I wondered if you would ever be able to catch up to a speeding train. Don’t get me wrong here, Indian trains are NOT fast and Dasher could easily smoke them, but I still was doubtful. As I turned my head on the pillow, there it was. Another tiny gift, so conspicuously placed that it would be the first thing I would see when I opened my eyes!

You never failed to surprise me. Every year you’d knock my socks off.

But I grew older. My childish innocence waned, and so did your visits. My only ‘authentic’ Christmas experience was gone. It took me a while to realise that it wasn’t really gone. I didn’t get presents on Christmas anymore. Instead, I had my dad recounting how he would meticulously fashion your visits. He would excitedly tell me how he used to tip-toe around the house as I slept, trying to sneak in gifts and leave various clues like muddy footprints and fake snow to make my naïve little self believe that the plump, red man had come for me after-all. And you know what? He nailed it everytime!

Christmas is here once again, and here I am with a mug of eggnog. Well it’s a little more rum than it is eggnog. The fairy lights illuminate the hall with their dull incandescence. The tinsels and baubles are glittering on the artificial tree that my kid decorated with such zeal. He’s asleep now, I hope. You will be keeping his present under the tree, and you will have been extremely messy while entering through the window, leaving large boot-prints all over the room for him to investigate. And I’m sure you know what you’ve brought him this year!He too may not experience Christmas the way his television friends do. He won’t experience snow and reindeer and carols and choirs. But, when he wakes up tomorrow morning, he will feel joy and surprise and excitement, and he will love Christmas. And that is because of his belief in Santa.

With loads of love and cheer,

A dad who never stopped believing.
