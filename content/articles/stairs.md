_(Part 5 of 6: Back to the Past)_

The final buzz, the vibrating phone lights up in the dimly lit corridor as I trudge my way back to my room, “Her birthday plan, meet up near basketball court for deets”. Oh, snap! I’d forgotten about her birthday, my mind spurs back into consciousness, now alert for the night to come. I rush to my room, put on a nice shirt (for the photos) and hurry back to the cycle stand, grab the cycle and pedal towards the basketball court.

Huffing and puffing as the cycle wobbles whilst I pedal against gravity on the road in between G.D.Birla and D.B.Ambani. My mind waging a back-and-forth war, “today’s the day, it’s her birthday, after all, it’s the best time to ask her out. But no, this is her day, I shouldn’t ruin it”, contemplating whether I should say the words I’ve been waiting so long to say. The cool breeze revitalizes my spirit as I cycle at a breakneck speed past hexagon, shrouded in darkness lest for the cool blue lights that drape on its scaffolding. “Hex is closed huh, could’ve used an ice cream around now,” I think to myself, shuddering in the cold (the irony of wanting ice cream now).

As I reach the basketball court (it’s lights off), I see a group of shadows, they wave at me, beckoning me to come to them. “Hey, guys!” I say as I bring the cycle to a halt, I’m greeted by hey’s and pats on the back as the details (tea) are spilt.

The plan is set, cake- check, all of us hiding near the golden jubilee building- check, her-cycling towards us after a text telling her to come to the workshop- check, a friend waiting there all alone as a distraction- check. The plan’s an obvious one. Then why the ploy? You might ask, but why not? I would reply, the fun is planning something so obvious and wishing for it to work, the wholesomeness of seeing it through is a beautiful feeling.

She gets there and notices the distraction, but she doesn’t notice the box and our smiles as we run toward her cheering, and the next 10 minutes, one could only describe them as pure bliss. Gleeful voices, breaking through the silent night. Hugs, wishes, songs and cake, the best part: all of us with cheeky grins on our faces, pelting cake at the birthday girl. The cheers and drama subside, and a conversation bubbles up, everyone’s in too good of a mood to just go back to their rooms. “Why don’t we go up?” Someone says, “Up where?” I ask, “Up there,” she says as she points to the freshly painted structure, the tallest building in the vicinity. The conversation now shifts toward the bright idea of scaling the structure, and a 10-minute debate, we head up the steps to its first floor.

My eyes now catch a glimpse of her in the darkness and the unstable flashlights from our phones, face covered in cake, but nonetheless she looks stunning, my heart skips a beat as we walk up the steps. We find the central staircase that takes us all the way up to our destination, a dark, musty, vertical expanse with tinted windows and black marble stairs leading us toward an even darker area. Chills run up my spine when I realize that we’ll have to climb thirteen flights of stairs under these circumstances. But nonetheless, we set off on our escapade, climbing the stairs, chatting while we walk in the darkness (save the flashlights from our phones). The birthday girl walks closer to me and stutters as she says “Umm, what do you think of our XX prof, _silence_ uh, have you noticed how he’s low-key a sadist?”, “Yeah, but I guess it’s cuz he’s just old and angsty” I reply nervously, she grins at the comment. Clearly the conversation is awkward, but who cares.

That smile, I don’t want to lose it, what if today doesn’t work out, would we still be friends? Then what would happen to that smile? Thoughts running past my mind, unsure about what path I should walk. Do I go with the flow? Or let things remain as they are now? What would happen to the six of us if I were to do it? I see too many repercussions if I were to utter those words, ones that I might not ever want to face. I think I’ll live with it as is, to ruin what the six of us have here for something so selfish, it wouldn’t seem right. They say if you love something, let it go, if it comes back, you’ll know it was meant to be. My fear riddled mind thinks we’re better as friends and I think it’s better to keep it that way.

After a couple more flights of stairs, we make it to the terrace, Oh the view! Everyone gasps in awe, the splendid sight before our eyes is a lot to take in. Beyond yonder, the city lights, tiny iridescent specs. And right under us, the campus, as still as water, with little people walking around like ants on the ground. The night is beautiful if only it wouldn’t end.
