Happy birthday Alice,

Wow! You are 18 already! Don’t worry. The yellow patches on this paper are not my tears, I promise. You are mature now and will understand life and death better.

I am writing this letter so that you know how I feel today, on 22nd October 1999, counting my last days. Every breath seems heavy. The cancer is not what is killing me; the helplessness is. Oh well! Now I realize what people said about time was right. I thought I had all the time in the world. All that I have now is a mere sheet of paper in my hands and you sitting palely in front of me. Why are you trying to smile and read poems to me? I hear the pain in your voice, honey. Your eyes filled with hope and tears. I can’t do anything about it.

My hands crumble as I write this letter. Words are falling short. How can I write everything here, everything that we would have talked about in the next 30 to 40 years? I see you secretly cry beside my deathbed every night, and it wrecks my heart. I am powerless, or maybe life is just unfair. Well, fate! Can I breathe a little longer? Can I please look at my daughter without fear? Please let me capture all her features in my eyes. Why do I kiss her forehead every time fearing it to be the last?

I remember the day you were born, kid. You held my fingers so tight and didn’t let it loose. Nothing has changed. You are still holding my finger tight, refusing to let me go. As I see you and your mother making desperate attempts to save me, all I want is to feel each of these moments till this chemo stops working, and I fade away in time.

Time? It just slipped away so soon. It’s hard to believe I have none anymore. All your giggles are in the air, the air I will never be able to breathe. All the school stories you blabber, I will never get to hear it. I wouldn’t be here to wipe your tears every time you fall off your cycle. I won’t be here to scold you for the mistakes that you do. Most importantly, I can’t believe that I won’t caress your face ever again. I don’t even know if I will be able to take away your memories to my coffin.

I am turning blue with each passing day. I wish the hope in your innocent eyes would come true. But I know it won’t. Do you know what my last wish is? Just one more day with you every day. But that’s not possible. Nobody can deceive death.

I am not willing to, but I have to leave you. If only I could explain how hard it is right now. My body is burning on the inside; the laser is not sufficient. And death looks like an easy option.

I know I have built a warrior. And you can take care of yourself from here on. You are 18 now. It’s 8 years since I left you that you are getting this letter. I am curious to know if your smile is still the same. How beautiful do you look when you are reading this? Do you still lock yourself in the bathroom when scolded? Do you still get excited seeing rain falling? Are you doing fine? I am sorry for, you don’t have a father now to tell if you are not doing fine. I hope you are still the same little girl I kissed while dying. Still strong enough to face every one of life’s hurdles. With my last breaths I realized that love is all I need. Time is all I want. From now on, you will have to guard yourself against evil, because I can’t. You’ll have to take care of Mom. Like I know you have done for so long. More importantly – never feel alone, never fall weak. Promise me it won’t matter if I am here with you or not.

I know I missed out on a lot. I don’t know how you have grown as a person. I know I wasn’t the savior shadow in your darkest time. But I hope you have learned all the values needed and have grown gracefully. Trust your instincts, and they will guide you. Your charisma will give life to people who are dying on the inside. I hope you know how magical your laughs are. I hope you know how precious you are. I hope the last time you cried was at my funeral and never ceased smiling since.

Love,
Dad.
