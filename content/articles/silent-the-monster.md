The clock strikes the time but you are still awake,
Thinking and thinking about the day that awaits.
Where you stand on the bridge in stillness & fear,
For a monstrous scream that drove you here.

Beneath you is a murky firth, between the two ends complain.
The oceans you spun, you must sail strong,
Your mind against the sail.
But your heart tells you to prevail.
To be stronger but lighter than ever again.

Hold on for the euphoric,
Endured to conflate the numb prosaic.
Silent, the monster’s scream,
To shine through the cold & dark dream.
Triumph the battle over mysterious pain,
Because there will be sunshine, no more rain.

You can run away from the tears,
The laughter of loved ones, you must hear.
You have all the right!
It is how the wounded souls fight.

Cycle the storm until you drown,
Push the thought of suicide away, put the knife down.

---

So here it is a letter for you, a letter you must not burn.
A letter that you’ll need for the uncertainty of the unknown
You must prevail. We must prevail.
A legacy must, left behind.
