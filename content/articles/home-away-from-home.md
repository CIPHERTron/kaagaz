**Q:** First things first, let's start with all three of you introducing yourselves.

**A:** “Hi, my name is Ramakant Sahu, my friends call me RK. I am from a small town called Padampur, it is in the Bargarh district of Odisha. I am currently in my final year of B.Tech. in Electrical engineering"

"Hello to everyone who might be reading this; my name is Shreya Srivastava, I don't really have a cool nickname, but Shreya does the job. I am presently residing in Bangalore, and my branch is Chemical Engineering, and I too am currently studying in my fourth year of B.Tech."

"Now my turn? So, I am Parul Rath, and I'm originally from Odisha, so in some messed up way or the other, joining college was my homecoming, going with the spiderman trend these days. Coming back to the crux of the question, I've spent all of my life in Riffa, which is a town in Bahrain, and my branch is Chemical Engineering; I am also in my final year."

**Q:** The idea for this interview is pretty simple; to give the juniors (and everyone) an idea about your college lives. You three in particular because of your contrasting backgrounds, meaning the cities you've lived in for most of your lives. So, basic questions first; What was your first memory of the institute that you can recollect? What expectations did you have from college when you first joined?

**A:**
**RK:** Everyone has their own supposed image of their college. The vast campus undoubtedly exceeded my expectations, and once you guys get to see it, you'll agree. More or less like any other fellow engineer or not even an engineer, any other college student; I also had a very filmy POV about college, but that's not how Indian colleges work. One myth that was busted was my presumption about academics in college. I used to think college would be a place where academics and studies would take a backseat, but no, it is pretty strict. But one aspect where my college did stand up to the expectations is the people of NITR. I got to make many new terrific friends who I can rely on at all times.

**Shreya:** First thing would be the enormity of the campus, but that was already mentioned by RK, so let me come up with something much more interesting. Ok, I gave it a thought; I quit. The campus itself is so scintillating that there's nothing else that you can focus on. It took us a lot of time to understand the campus and almost felt like something only seen in movies. However, despite many students coming to the campus, it was surprisingly quiet when I first entered. The campus as a whole was breathtaking with all its beautiful greenery and buildings.

**Parul:** To be very honest, at first, I wasn't very excited about the whole idea of moving to NITR because who doesn't love their home; so, my expectations for this whole college thing were not like the generic Karan Johar movie types, sorry RK. The bar for me was already set very low. My plan was simple; go with the flow. Dead fish go with the flow, but that was the plan. The first memory of college that I can recollect was that it was green, like green green, might sound dumb, but everyone needs to understand that where I was from, this wasn't normal. What made everything more beautiful were the people; the interactions as a whole were something. Yes, something is the word I'd like to go with because it's just indescribable.

**Q:** Now, the next question for you guys is something we first and second years can't relate to because of our whole internet-driven college experience; How did you feel about the strict attendance system?

**A:**
**RK:** It was pretty surprising for me, like is attendance in college even a thing, were we going back to school? In the first semester, I did not miss a single class because I was scared that I'd be debarred for skipping classes, but gradually, you come to know of different "cheat codes" that help you work around this attendance pain.

**Shreya:** Hmm so I guess the attendance system is somewhat fine until you start your semester. Initially the high spirits get to you and you always think that despite the number of holidays that you have, you are going to be much more productive and that you will be able to totally manage it. but soon you find regret knocking on your doors making you feel stupid for missing out on classes just because you felt you wanted to have a nice and peaceful breakfast or just get a bit more sleep. By the time midsems arrive most of the students would have already exhausted their holidays and would already be scrambling for days. However I feel that the strict attendance system does infact keep us on our toes because of the fact that it is very easy to lose yourself into the fests or other activities and because there is nobody to monitor you.

**Parul:** Hearing this, I feel like I am from a different generation altogether. I feel like I thought of college as an extension of school. I didn't miss any classes in my first year except for the leaves I took for the debate tournaments I attended. Now that I think about it, the whole not-missing class sounds like such a classical sob story, but trust me it was nothing like that; I simply found my reasons to go and attend lectures. Sadly, my life wasn't spicy enough to have a boy as the motivation; my roommates were the only motivating factor for me to attend lectures.

**Q:** We wish we're also able to find this sort of motivation for ourselves, you know, for daily motivation. Coming from the places you all have spent most of your lives in, what were some of the significant challenges you faced moving into college?

**A:**
**RK:** My upbringing was not particularly from a small town; I have lived in bigger towns and cities but only in hostels. You won’t believe me but I have lived in a hostel since I was three years old. This is my 18th year as a hosteller. And I’m 22(Yikes!). You can say I know hostels more than my own home. So I didn't face any difficulties in terms of food quality, interacting with strangers, or making new friends. I believe the campus is more like a village with all the general necessities provided. It wasn't something I couldn't adjust to. Trust me I have lived way worse haha.

**Shreya:** Wow, RK, you just called our college a village, but I won't argue against it. The first challenge for me per se was waking up for breakfast because the freedom campus life provides you with is immense; You never really get called on time, especially for breakfast. Another one is when you get sick, there is literally nobody to take care of you. You don't receive any privileged treatment or that "garam pani" we all desire during that sore throat phase. The third challenge would be budgeting because there isn't anyone to keep tabs on your budget; It gets exhausted within a short duration. At home, there are many defined rules that all disappear once you're on campus. Another thing to keep in mind is the curfew and the restrictions you have at your house, which lose their meaning in the campus. Therefore, your schedule gets messed up as you end up staying late and pushing back all your other daily assignments and stuff.

**Parul:** There exists a powerful contrast between life back home and in college. Life there is lazy, to say the least, and the lifestyle itself is very different. Everything is so very efficient there like I remember in my first year, I had to open my bank account, and the amount of effort it took from my end was phenomenal. Another problem I faced was the confusion about how the economy works here; my method was simple: if something cost like 200 bucks here, I would convert it and check if it sounds fair with the cost back home. This didn't end well for me, so don't go with this method. All in all, I think the change that I saw was me becoming a more independent person from a more dependent previous me.

**Q:** Since NITR is home to students from different cultures and areas of the world, did you feel zonism or groupism at any point of time during your stay on campus?

**A:**
**RK:** If a person comes from a particular area for e.g I come from a small town where we have our own local dialect and if I meet people who speak that tongue, then I will naturally be more comfortable around them. But this should not stop me from getting into conversation with others. My personal opinion on zonism is that yes, it is problematic when it comes to elections, administrative duties, or responsibilities in SAC-related stuff. But at the same time stigmatising any group of friends by labelling it zonism just because they are from a certain region is not justified.

**Shreya:** Groupism is a big deal. But then the clubs help out a lot to negate this effect. The club culture on campus allows you to make a lot more friends and be more open towards others. NITR has a lot of clubs that help out. However, it is essential to note that what matters, in the end, is always your individuality.

**Parul:** So, the thing is that I know Odia, which is the home state language, which means like 50% of the college's population prefers speaking that language. Being an Odia also benefited me here as I didn't have any sort of cultural shock coming to campus, and I got to be a part of different circles. Still, coming to the question, I don't think defining all this as zonism is particularly justified, and RK gave the perfect reasoning for the same. Interacting in different circles at the end of the day helped me learn a lot, and I'm very thankful for that.

**Q:** So we've reached the end of this interview, and we'd like to thank you all for your time and insights into college life. That being said, the final question for you all is: what advice would you like to give to your incoming juniors?

**A:**
**RK:** Honestly, I don't think I am not qualified enough to be someone who can give advice to juniors. There are better people around. But an honest suggestion would be to just be in the moment. You have always been running from one thing to another. In 10th,you were told to get through matriculation and enjoy later; in 12th, you were told to get through it, and your life will be chill in college, and then you get into college and you start worrying about internships, PPOs and jobs. Whoa! Hold on.
For the first time in your life you have some sort of complete freedom. So don’t start worrying about career plans and all that from the beginning. You are still very young to decide on your entire life based on these 4 yrs. You were smart enough to get past JEE, you are smart enough to work around things. Invest your time in something that you really wanted to do but haven't been able to because of being in a marathon since childhood. Everything else you can modify after a point, but you cannot get back the past. So meet new people, try new things and then decide what you want to get hooked on to. These 4 years are not coming back. Be alive for now. All this might sound reckless and pompous for some people but you asked me and this is what I believe in. It has kept me sane haha.

**Shreya:** My advice would be to not settle for something you thought you would enjoy and instead to try experimenting even if you get a lot of disappointments on the way. Disappointments are a part of growth, and it's just a step up rather than a step back and is mainly what college is all about. Just keep pushing through, and after four years, there will be things that your younger self would envy. Another one of my biggest pieces of advice would be not to let your CG drop as it matters at every point of your life and career.

**Parul:** I suddenly feel so old. Damn. I honestly am not feeling qualified enough to answer this, but to be honest, the four years you're going to have in this college are going to be great. Try everything that you possibly can in these four years; just keep this one thing in the back of your mind that is don't have fun at the cost of your career and academics in general, and more importantly, make friends who fit the age-old definition of the word itself. Personally, make friends in whose weddings you'll be dancing in; that's the end goal in my opinion. So, always choose quality over quantity, just like the interview you took right here.
