“I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They’re really saying I love you-”

As if Louis Armstrong had tapped into my thoughts and seen through me, all that I have seen, all that I see.

Begone and juvenile. What a satisfying yet confusing emotion; so full of sorrow, accompanied by tears of joy. But I guess it isn’t only the change of my drapes from the blackout curtains to roman shades that makes me ancient. It’s the change of the look of wonder in a little lad’s eyes while he walks through a bazaar filled with the joys of colors and sounds replaced with the attention that little black box in his hand demands today.

But this piece is not about that.

When one comes into a house to buy or rent, he looks at the furniture and what drapes to dress me in. Little does he think about what he feels and what he wants to see through me. It isn’t the ocean or the beach or the sea. What a young man yearns for is chaos. To watch the busy lives of a busy day. Crying children wanting attention; the thug running away with the silver purse; the golden girls busy in their brisk walk yet not so brisk to fail to notice the world around them; the boy with the yellow rose standing at that corner cheese shop, waiting for the girl with brown pigtails and rosy cheeks who is happily striding across the street towards him, coming to show him her favorite pink frock. While this man thinks about the proximity of the house to his hotshot corporate office, he doesn’t realize that what he would go on to regret after many years is that he never got to sit for hours and just observe this chaotic realm out there with all the time in the world.

I have also seen plenty of crazy in my time. I have seen hundreds of people go crazy all at once, together. I never quite understood how that sizeable black statue of the frightening lady with her tongue out could bring so many the amount of peace, tranquil, hope and joy, that it does. The thump of the drums accompanied by the clanging of cymbals, people dancing to its infectious rhythm with inexplicable energy. Frenzied dance with pots full of burning coal, coconut husk held by hands, deft swift movements amidst clouds of incense. The environment itself, was always too intoxicating. Almost made me a believer.

I remember Mrs. Goldman, looking through me, day in and day out, at that dusty brown swing-set. It attracted more dust, in the sorry excuse of a lawn. She was an opera singer in her day, a beautiful one at it too. Yet she sat by me and murmuredthe only tune she remembered.

‘Old McDonald had a farm, yee Aaye ee aye oh.’

‘Twas the first song her amiable little boy sang to her. And now she looked on, waiting eagerly for the day he’d finally return home from that dredged place people called Dunkirk, and she’d make him a bowl of his favorite tomato soup.

But the moment I genuinely felt with all my existence was when she wheeled herself into the room witha strong cup of coffee and its warm vapors fogged me up. She wiped the condensation off me as we both looked far into the horizon as Little Brie bid her little paper boat adieu in a puddle, as the rain began to subside. She then decided to make the biggest splash she could ever imagine. The tiny girl covered in mud, looked up and saw the first rainbow of her life and just kept staring at it in awe. While her mother on the other side went on to shed a tear, a tear of joy. The joy of her daughter being able to experience everything she ever dreamed of, with herself sitting on the wheelchair. And she sang-

“I hear babies crying; I watch them grow
They’ll learn much more than I’ll never know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world”
