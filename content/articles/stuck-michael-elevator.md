It seemed to be another frantic morning in the ironically lazy and uneventful suburban town of Scranton, Pennsylvania. As usual, I went about my day, starting off with my essential dose of caffeine. On my way out of the rather serene Starbucks, I bumped into a damned skateboarding teenager who had me absolutely drenched in piping hot, sticky coffee. I hopelessly tried to dab away the stain and the stench, but time seemed to be on a mission of its own by speeding itself an entire hour! It was already 9.30 AM. I was an hour late for my first day at work! It looked like I would even set a record for getting fired before I even started my job. I thought my boss was totally going to kill me and, to add to that, I was going to look like an embarrassment unless I could somehow look like a Burberry model with this white shirt that went south. Today was just not my day!

After going almost 20 mph over the speed limit on the highway, I finally reached the office. I ended up parking my car a mile away because all the parking spots were taken. I finally mustered up the courage to lift my panic-stricken legs out of the car, and I made my way into the building. Just as the elevator doors were about to close, the bell rang ‘DING!’

Almost like a knight in shining armor, a man with a foot covered in bubble wrap walked in the elevator and grunted, “I am dead inside.”

“Well, Good morning to you too,” I replied without knowing how to respond to that. An awkward silence ensued, and all of a sudden the elevator went dark.

“OH GOD PLEASE NO, GOD PLEASE NO” the man erupted. The elevator is stuck! “I’m okay, I’m okay, I’m okay …. no, I’m not” the odd man kept repeating to himself. As if the day couldn’t get any worse, I had a panic attack. “Hey, we can get through this, just stay calm and I’ll try to call the building authorities.” the stranger immediately added after expressing his worry to the highest heavens. I began to hyperventilate, everything that could wrong in my life just seemed to be happening.

“I can’t do this, this is way too hard for me.”

“That’s what she said,” the man murmured under his breath.

“What?” I asked.

“Nothing. It’s nothing. Let me get back to that call,” he added. We finally got a response from one of the building authorities and I felt a sense of relief for the first time.

“You look like you had a rough morning,” I stated as I tried to take my mind off the situation.

“Well, I burnt my foot, so I’m clearly off to a hot start,” he said.

“You burnt your foot?” I replied in utter shock.

“Yes, today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot… that’s it. I don’t see what’s so hard to believe about that,” he replied, nonchalantly.

I burst out with laughter without any remorse for his eardrums.

“Hey, you know what, I like your…shirt. Is this what millennials call ‘fashion’ these days?” he said in a sarcastic tone as he scanned my suit covered in coffee stains.

“I didn’t have a very great start to the day either” I replied in a melancholic tone.
“I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to get off on the wrong foot… actually never mind. I’m Michael Scott, I run Scranton’s Dunder Mifflin branch,” Mr Scott said.

“Oh my, a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Scott. I’m the intern that was supposed to join today”, I replied in embarrassment.

“Oh what that’s awesome, let’s do a welcome dance” Michael pulled out his phone and started dancing to Beyonce. “I am Beyonce always,” he enforced. I initially thought of just standing still, but the energy was so infectious, I couldn’t help myself. “I love my employees even though I hit one of them with my car!” he yelled over the music. Even though I was weirded out, I couldn’t help myself from dancing and laughing my brains out.

Hours passed, but the time just seemed to have flown by because he had me laughing the whole time and made me completely forget the whole situation. The elevator thudded and finally started moving again. “Hallelujah!” Michael exclaimed followed by an awkward high five. I finally made it out of the elevator into the office. “Hey, everyone I’m sorry I’m late” Michael announced. “I burnt my foot then got stuck in an elevator, in that order.” He quickly added as the rest of the office chuckles. “Oh, would you all just shut it? Anyways I’d like for all of you to welcome our new intern, and the only right way to welcome him is by celebrating. Party planning committee, get on it. That’s right everyone conference room in 5,” Michael screamed with sheer excitement. And for some reason, they seemed to be applauding for me.

This has got to be the weirdest day. But I love this place already; the people and the vibes are just fun, sometimes I wonder if these people ever get any work done here? But to celebrate an absolute mess like me, this place really must be the best People Persons Paper People company.
