Letters have always been an incredibly romantic form of communication. Perhaps it is the beauty of tumbling emotions behind the veil of unique penmanship, or perhaps it is the sublime luxury of having someone devote so much time into inking their thoughts, just for you. The way the handwriting curves, the way the I’s are dotted, and the way the stray marks of a lingering pen decorate the pages, they are all a soothing parallel to an actual person speaking and fumbling and mumbling in front of you. It is this sense of personality and exclusivity that makes a letter so precious. I say this so confidently because once I chanced upon my mother perusing through yellowed sheets with wrinkled creases with a satisfactory, sentimental sparkle in her eyes.

It got me thinking. I haven’t received letters pretty much ever. I grew up experiencing a different way of keeping in touch, by literally keeping in touch. I don’t remember spending many weekends alone, and if I did it was bearing around with nearby relatives.

For people placed afar, what kept us connected was the big and conspicuous landline telephone that sat proudly in the most centralized location of the house. At least an hour every week was the designated family time where the handset would do a complicated exchange of hands on each side of the wire, so every family-member had spoken to each other. Who wouldn’t remember twirling that twisted cord around your fingers in a knotty mess while lost in conversation with a friend? Wasn’t just a little bend in that symmetric spiral always so violently unsettling?

But we had too much to express and that little box was too restrictive. Remembering phone numbers was a pain, the wail like siren of the landline was too annoying and the roam around factor was limited to the cords length. So, technology gifted us the mobile phone!

Slowly, texting became the new black. Be it e-mails or IMs, everyone’s thumbs would be tapping rhythmically on a tiny keypad. Did you just spot a celebrity? Win a prize? Bake a cake? You could immediately let anyone know, anytime and anywhere, without having to call and expecting them to be free as well. You didn’t have to huddle around the landline awkwardly for hours, awaiting your turn. That convenience was now at your fingertips.

With the rise of internet, texting has now switched platforms to social media. We don’t write to or call or text anybody close. We don’t need to. Speaking to just one person at a time is impractical! We call out to the entire world! All our troubles go out to them and we find hundreds who empathize. We know about the adventures of our friends and families by their Facebook and Instagram posts, not by those drawling telephonic conversations. It’s not just text and voice anymore either. Emotions and expressions that we could never express now come out through emojis! Were we ever able to express ourselves as liberally as we can now?

Sadly, we have only drifted apart. Under the illusion of being connected with the whole world, we’ve lost connect with those close-by. Get-togethers are lighted by telephone screens instead of delighted faces and “what’s the Wi-Fi password?” are the first words hosts hear when guests enter. The minions of our communication have changed from voice and letters to texts and emojis. Whether they come from a stranger or from a lover, those yellow emoji faces are all the same; all cold and unwelcoming. That exclusivity and that personal touch that we used to have in our cumbly letters with clumsy handwriting has disappeared.

Do we miss it? Video calls and voice chats are trying to bridge that chasm. The active development of VR technologies in the direction of communication are also attractive. The world where we could put on a pair of headsets to immediately get transported to our loved ones’ houses might not be far away. To get together again, even virtually, and laugh and giggle amidst a warm and welcoming presence instead of snorting at a text on a cold metal block in our hands? Is that something we await impatiently? Or does it seem like the oblivion of social media can suffice our needs for a long time to come? To each their own, I guess.
